# physrisk-crop
Crop vulnerability modelling
This repo aims to provide example, usable code for both customisable basic models, and DSSAT implementations, using appropriate input data from an agricultural portfolio.
These files are a work-in-progress, and more files will be added in due course (reserving the right to amend/remove files as needed). 
DSSAT intgrated vulnerability "power" user files assume you are not using the official DSSAT UI, but running it in command-line instead. DSSAT UI tools can be downloaded upon application to https://get.dssat.net/request/?sft=4
